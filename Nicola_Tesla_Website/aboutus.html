        <h1>About Research</h1>
        1. Groundbreaking Work on Alternating Current (AC) <br /><br />
        Nikola Tesla's research revolutionized the way electricity is generated,
        transmitted, and utilized. His most notable contribution was the
        development and implementation of alternating current (AC) systems,
        which proved to be far more efficient than the direct current (DC)
        systems of his time. Tesla's inventions, such as the induction motor and
        transformers, formed the foundation of modern power distribution,
        enabling electricity to be transmitted across vast distances. His work
        on AC technology not only resolved technical limitations but also
        ignited the "War of Currents," solidifying his place as a visionary in
        the field of electrical engineering.
        <br /><br />2. Wireless Energy Transmission <br /><br />
        Tesla dedicated years of research to the idea of wireless energy
        transmission, believing it could provide the world with free, limitless
        power. Through experiments at his Colorado Springs lab and the
        construction of the Wardenclyffe Tower, Tesla demonstrated the
        feasibility of transmitting energy without wires using the Earth’s
        natural conductivity. While his ambitious project faced financial and
        technical setbacks, Tesla’s research paved the way for modern wireless
        technologies, influencing fields such as telecommunications and wireless
        charging. His vision of global wireless energy remains an inspiration to
        scientists and innovators today.
        <br /><br />3. Advancements in Radio and Remote Control <br /><br />
        Tesla’s experiments extended beyond electricity to include
        groundbreaking work in radio waves and remote control. In 1898, he
        showcased a radio-controlled boat, demonstrating the potential for
        wireless communication in technology. Despite being overshadowed by
        competitors like Guglielmo Marconi, Tesla’s research laid the groundwork
        for radio communication and remote-controlled devices. His
        contributions, often uncredited during his lifetime, are now recognized
        as pivotal in shaping modern technologies such as drones, robotics, and
        wireless networks. Tesla’s relentless curiosity and innovative spirit
        continue to influence the technological landscape.
